# Angel

Angel is my pet project and redesign of the website for a not-for-profit foundation in Chicago that raises money for Polish children who cannot afford cancer treatment. I chose to redesign this website because I think the foundation's current page is outdated and some design concepts on the page make no sense to me.

##AngularJS and Bootstrap 3

This website is built using AngularJS 1.5 and Twitter Bootstrap 3. I chose to use AngularJS for this project because I wanted the practice using the framework. I also wanted to see how flexible it was in creating a non-app-based website and implement some ideas I had before I started the project. JavaScript is a language I enjoy using and this gave me a chance to hone some of my Angular skills. I chose Bootstrap 3 due to my previous experience with it and ease of use when it came to mobile compatibility. 

As the project progressed, however, I realized that I could have focused less on using the Angular framework and made this process a bit simpler using just standard Bootstrap 3. If I were to be asked by the foundation to do this for them for real, I'd likely just do that and use Angular on pages such as the How We Help and Board of Directors sections.
